## Database Workflow  

- **Backend Overview**:  
  The system connects to a database (e.g., MongoDB/MySQL) where all medical records, user details, and appointment data are stored.  
- **Data Flow**:  
  1. **Doctor Uploads**: Patient data is uploaded by doctors into the system via forms.  
  2. **Database Operations**: Using **Mongoose** (for MongoDB) or **Sequelize** (for SQL), CRUD operations are performed to handle patient records, appointments, and reports.  
  3. **Real-Time Access**: Patients and doctors can retrieve, modify, and visualize their data in real time via the dashboard.  
- **Security Measures**:  
  Authentication and authorization are implemented using **JWT** tokens and **bcrypt** for password encryption, ensuring secure data transmission.

## Features  

- **Dynamic Healthcare Dashboard**: Supports dynamic service loading through Handlebars.js or EJS.  
- **User Types**: Different portals for patients and doctors.  
- **Offline Consultation**: Integrated Google Maps for location-based services.  
- **Real-Time Appointment Management**: Allows seamless booking and tracking.
